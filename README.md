### Hi there 👋

I'm Eduardo Almeida, a software engineer based in 🇵🇹 Porto, Portugal.

My focus is on 📱 mobile development, and I'm currently creating the mobile app for the future of business banking, [Juni](https://juni.co)!

I also publish apps for 🍎 Apple platforms under the name [Bitten Apps](https://bittenapps.com).

As for OSS (which is probably what you're here about!), I dabble in random stuff from time to time - just take a look at my repositories!

💬 To reach me, please check the page located [here](https://eduardo.engineer/contact)!
