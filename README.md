### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eduardo Almeida, a software engineer based in Porto, Portugal.

My current focus is on ðŸ“± mobile development, and I'm currently creating the mobile app for the financial platform for e-commerce: [Juni](https://juni.co) ðŸš€!

I also publish iOS/macOS apps under [Bitten Apps](https://bitten.app).

As for OSS (which is probably what you're here about!), I dabble in random stuff from time to time - just take a look at my repositories!

ðŸ’¬ To reach me, please check the page located [here](https://eduardo.engineer/contact)!
