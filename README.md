### Hi there 👋

I'm Eduardo Almeida, a software engineer based in Porto, Portugal.

My current focus is on 📱 iOS development, and I'm currently part of the team that makes the Trainline app.

As for OSS, I dabble in random stuff from time to time, but I am currently maintaining [FruityRazer](https://github.com/FruityRazer), open-source drivers for Razer peripherals on 🍎 macOS.
