### Hi there 👋

I'm Eduardo Almeida, a software engineer based in Porto, Portugal.

My current focus is on 📱 mobile development, and I'm currently part of the platform team for [Juni](https://juni.co) 🚀.

I also publish iOS/macOS apps under [Bitten Apps](https://bitten.app).

As for OSS (which is probably what you're here about!), I dabble in random stuff from time to time, but I am currently maintaining [FruityRazer](https://github.com/FruityRazer), open-source drivers for Razer peripherals on 🍎 macOS.

💬 To reach me, please check the page located [here](https://eduardo.engineer/contact)!
