### Hi there 👋

I'm Eduardo Almeida, a software engineer based in Porto, Portugal.

My current focus is on 📱 iOS development, and I'm currently part of the team that makes the [Trainline](https://github.com/trainline) app for iOS.

I also publish iOS/macOS apps under [Bitten Apps](https://bitten.app).

As for OSS (which is probably what you're here about!), I dabble in random stuff from time to time, but I am currently maintaining [FruityRazer](https://github.com/FruityRazer), open-source drivers for Razer peripherals on 🍎 macOS.

💬 To reach me, please use the form [here](https://eduardo.engineer/contact/)!
